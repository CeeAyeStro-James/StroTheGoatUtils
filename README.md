A personal collection of **C# utility classes** written for use in Unity projects.  
This repo is mainly for my own development workflow, but feel free to explore if you stumble upon it.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project contains a single C# file that defines a set of **abstract** and **static classes** with general-purpose helper methods.  
The utilities are meant to reduce boilerplate, speed up common tasks, and provide reusable logic across Unity projects.

---

## ðŸ›  Features
- Abstract base classes for shared patterns.
- Static helper methods for quick access to common functionality.
- Designed to be **lightweight** and **self-contained** (just one file).
- Easy to drop into any Unity project.

## ðŸš€ Installation
1. Clone or download this repository.  
2. Copy the `GitUtils.cs` file into your Unity project (e.g., inside `Assets/Scripts/Utils/`).  
3. Start using the utility classes in your scripts.
